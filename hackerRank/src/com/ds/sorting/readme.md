//Sorting Problems

Sorting is ordering a list of objects. We can distinguish two types of sorting. If the number of objects is small enough to fits into the main memory, sorting is called internal sorting. If the number of objects is so large that some of them reside on external storage during the sort, it is called external sorting. In this chapter we consider the following internal sorting algorithms

Bucket sort
Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Heapsort
Mergesort
